# AbyssEngine

To be used for upcoming game AbyssWalker.

Written in C++ with OpenGL.
The purpose of the project is to gain experience with creating a fully fleshed out
project for once, which hopefully will be a very learningful experience.
I would also like for the project to be able to serve as an example for others who wish
to create something similar. If you wish to do so, please keep in mind that this is my first proper
project made with c++, and should be treated as such.
